```
Tsukamaete, hora kono shooting star
A world of our fiction awaits
Zutto onaji mainichi ni mayoi ga atte mo
Kizukanai furi wo shitetanda
Honno chotto no yuuki ga mada dasenakutte
Madoromu uchuu de samayotte ita
Yozora ni ukabu
Hoshi ni negai wo kakerunda
I hope... idaiteru yume wo
Zettai akira metakunai
Hashiridasu kara
Oikakete ima ano shooting star
Mita koto no nai sutoorii susunde ikun da
Itsu no hi ni ka kitto
Egaita sekai e tadoritsukeru you ni
Let go
Of the days you thought mattered so
Life goes on, tomorrow's rolling in
Is it the world we know, or the dream we sought so long?
Motto dare demo nai jibun ni naritain da
Atarashii kaze ga kokoro wo yurashita
It takes something to believe
The wish we wеre promised could really comе to life
And so, if this is how the story goes
To find that strength inside, I’ll remember why back then
You took my hand, and you said
Tsukamaete, hora kono shooting star
Saa, mazu wa ippo fumidashite osorezu ni yukou
Itsu no hi ni ka kitto
Mada minu sekai e tadori tsukeru you ni
Yoake ni saita tsuki ga mabayui buruu no sora ni toketeku
You and I, an undecided future
Doesn't matter if the final truth hurts
Mou sugu asa ga ugokidasu kara
Dakishimete ima kono shooting star
Mita koto no nai sutoorii
I'll be here betting on that
Fearsome heart
’Cause you're that shooting star
It's hopeless now, but maybe if you take that step
Into the darkness, you'll find me
Running by your side until the dawn
In the end, it's you and me
Us against tomorrow
Face the world that we had dreamed
Dry your eyes, and don't look back
